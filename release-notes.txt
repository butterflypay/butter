Release Notes


Version 1.3.2.0

Changes
 - Implemented PoS V2
    
    
 - Removed Thin mode staking
    The network relies on full nodes for security.
    Staking should be a reward for maintaining a full node.
    

 - Removed hash from DiskBlockIndex
    hash is saved in the key, no need to save it twice, 32 bytes saved per block
    Key prefix "blockindex" changed to "bidx", 36 bytes saved per block
    
    
    The TXDB version has been raised to 70510.
    
    On first boot the nodes will wipe any database before 70509 and initialise
    a reindex, which will reload the TXDB from the stored blockchain.
    
    For Databases of verson 70509 an migration will run, significantly faster
    than a reindex.  All existing nodes should be on txdb version 70509.
    
    Thin nodes don't store the blockchain and will need to redownload.
    
    Note: Reindexing the chain could cause your failed stake transactions to be
    detected as occuring during the reindex, and displayed at the top of the
    transaction list.  They can be removed by running clearwallettransactions
    followed by reloadanondata.
